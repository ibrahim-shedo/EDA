# Real Estate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Introduction

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real estate datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can inform decision-making in the real estate industry. The analysis leverages Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and Sweetviz to visualize and interpret the data effectively.

## Objectives

- To understand the distribution of housing prices across different regions.
- To identify factors influencing property values.
- To compare properties between train and test sets.
- To explore correlations between various features and house prices.

## Methodology

### Data Sources

- `brasil_1.csv`: Initial dataset containing basic property details.
- `brasil_2.csv`: Additional dataset with more detailed property information.

### Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Sweetviz**: Interactive EDA reports generation.

### Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing key metrics like mean, median, mode.
3. **Visual Exploration**: Using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new variables to capture complex relationships.
5. **Modeling Insights**: Applying machine learning models to predict property prices.

## Results

(Include summaries of key findings here, such as price distributions, significant correlations, and any interesting patterns observed.)

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis, clone the repository and ensure you have the required Python environment setup. Install necessary libraries using pip:

bash pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn sweetviz


Run the Jupyter Notebook (`Brasil EDA.ipynb`) to start the analysis.
